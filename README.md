# Scribe Notation
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

Scribe Notation is a note taking app which utilizes node.js and express.js. The app is currently hosted on Heroku.

My motivation for this project was to learn more about express.js and apply my knowledge to create API routes for a site. This site utilizes GET, POST, and DELETE routes for the notes. Storage is a simple JSON file.

## Installation

Simply clone the repo.

## Usage

Site: https://scribe-notation.herokuapp.com/

This app will not work on github.io and must be deployed to a hosting service like Heroku. The app itself is simple to use, simply navigate to the 'Notes' page and start creating notes! You can read, create, and delete notes.
